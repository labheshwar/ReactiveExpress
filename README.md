# Reactive Express - An E-Commerce Website 🌐📦

🚀 I believe the MERN Stack is capable of building any web application imaginable, and I proved it with Reactive Express! This project was assigned to me as the culmination of my MERN Stack Apprenticeship at Slim Coder. Building my first proper MERN Stack application was an exhilarating, challenging, joyful, and fun experience.
